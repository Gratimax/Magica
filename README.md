Greetings everyone! I know there's a lot of people asking me to update this plugin. The reason the plugin underwent a code freeze was because I was too occupied with school. With a fresh new mind coming in to the summer, I am able to update the plugin again. (For those of you asking, I did the previous versions over winter break.)

With a fresh mind, I have decided to do a full recode: deleting the repo(probably shouldn't have done that), and starting over from scratch. Yes, this probably sounds like a terrible idea, but I the previous versions were created by me while learning Java, with much inefficient and bad code. In addition, I can add awesome new features faster and more efficiently.

I am also programming an auto-update plugin(CubUpdate) to make updating Magica significantly easier(you can even set it to update itself, automatically!). Eventually, I have a _grand_ plan for all plugins, but that comes later.

If you want, download the latest _unstable_ version [here](https://github.com/Gratimax/Magica/raw/master/deploy/unstable.jar).

I plan on finishing the recode by the end of July. More details on that soon!
