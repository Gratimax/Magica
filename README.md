Magica is _mostly_ back in business! I've started adding spells again, and am re-coding some more advanced spells. Expect permissions support by the next stable build.

Magica is a simple, awesome Magic plugin for Bukkit. Right click with a book in hand to view all the spells. Say the casting name(in purple) to select a spell, and left click with a wand to cast it.
